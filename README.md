income and poverty trends in the Delaware Valley 1990-2016

**About the title** The original title of this project was "Suburbanization of Poverty," which is problematic for at least two reasons:

1. The name makes assumptions about where low-income residents move in our region over time.
2. The primary input data are persons with incomes below 200% of FPL (the Federal Poverty Level), which is better defined as low-income.

Until we come up with a better name, I'm using the uninformative abbreviation of SoP.

## Goals

- [x] Download and prep Census data on low-income residents (defined as below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level) for 1990, 2000, 2010, 2017
- [x] Incorporate basic data on population change
- [x] Clean data s.t. a maximum number of tracts are preserved over the study period
- [ ] Harmonize census tract boundaries to 2010 boundaries
- [ ] Identify clusters of absolute percentage low-income residents * percentage change low-income residents
- [x] Evaluate coefficients of variation for 2017 ACS estimates
- [ ] Test for statistically significant changes where possible
- [ ] Percentage of low-income residents and percentage change relative to county and relative to region
- [ ] Create maps of absolute and relative percentage change with MCD labeling
- [ ] Percentage of low-income residents (*y*) by distance (*x*)
- [ ] Incorporate objective measures of school quality, housing prices, affordable housing development, and health indicators
